<p id="about-info">
    I am an artist, experienced in working with Adobe products such as Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere, and InDesign. I am also skilled in HTML 5 and CSS, and I have experience in graphic design, film, and photography. I have recieved awards from the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards in 2016, 2018, and 2019, earning me one honorable mention and two silver keys. I designed for the Bubl app and Cab Calloway Winter Showcase logo in 2018/2019. I’m a team player in work environments, accustomed to working with technology, and flexible and hard-working. I’m experienced, willing to learn, and open to new ideas. My work covers a wide range, from paintings and sketches to photography and this very website.
